            <h1>Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins “is the introductory ordinance of the gospel” of Jesus Christ and must be preceded by faith in the Savior and by sincere repentance. This ordinance “is a sign and a commandment which God has set for [His children] to enter into His kingdom.” Baptism is administered in the authority of the Aaronic Priesthood. In the process of coming unto the Savior and spiritual rebirth, baptism provides a necessary initial cleansing of our soul from sin.</h1>

            <p>Christ, who is perfect, was baptized to fulfil all righteousness, so we who are not perfect have more need to be baptized and follow Christ's example.</p3>

            <p>Those who hold the keys and authority of the Priesthood can baptize others.</p>

            <p>The first step toward Christ is through repentance and baptism by immersion for the remission of sins.</p3>
